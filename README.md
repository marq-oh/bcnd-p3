# Project: Ethereum Dapp for tracking items

## Description
Third project for Blockchain Developer course, the intent of the project was to create a Dapp supply chain solution backed by the Ethereum platform. This involved architecting smart contracts that manage specific user permission controls as well as contracts that track and verify a productâ€™s authenticity. (See [Original ReadMe](https://github.com/marq-oh/bcnd-p3/blob/master/README_orig.md) for complete instructions)

## Write-Up / Details
### Part 1: Plan the project with write-ups
TBD

Also, see [UML Files](https://github.com/marq-oh/bcnd-p3/tree/master/UML)

### Part 2: Write smart contracts
See [contracts folder](https://github.com/marq-oh/bcnd-p3/tree/master/project-6/contracts)

### Part 3: Test smart contract code coverage
See [test folder](https://github.com/marq-oh/bcnd-p3/blob/master/project-6/test)

### Part 4: Deploy smart contracts on a public test network (Rinkeby)
TBD

### Part 5: Modify client code to interact with smart contracts
TBD

### Optional: Implement Infura to store product image
TBD
